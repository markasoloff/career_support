What are you looking for in a work environment?

I am looking to work in an environment that is 
supportive, intellectually stimulating, inclusive, secure (business-wise and safety-wise), accommodating, and respectful.


What environments have you liked best thus far and why? 

Size: I most enjoyed working on a team of eight with one manager inside a large, non-profit museum. I liked the close relationships I had with my teammates and the relative job security that being part of an established organization provided. 

Level of interaction with others: I like having a team of peers/equals to converse with, but I also value the freedom and independence of being solely responsible for my work. I enjoy interacting with the public, but only in short, infrequent doses.

 
Relationship with coworkers: 
I like being on a small team of people with equal authority to myself. I like being a peer and ideally a friend-coworker more than a subordinate or supervisor.

Relationship with boss(es):
I like a buddy-boss with whom I can be truly honest. I like when the boss respects my ability to get the job done, and supports me when I am in need of support. I want a boss who does not micromanage, but also stays involved enough to appreciate my efforts.
 
Mentorship:
I like a laid-back mentor who provides feedback and advice when asked, but does not insist that I do things her way. I want someone who has “been there” to guide me.

Decision-making:
I like when I am granted the authority to make decisions about my work as I see fit. I do not like to have to make a case for my decisions, or gain consensus from a group. That said, I want the ability to solicit input from my stakeholders when I feel I need more direction.
 
Level of authority:
I love having autonomy. I do not want to have to ask permission for every little thing. I love the ability to set my own schedule and improvise as necessary. I do not like having direct-reports under me who I have to supervise. I’d much rather do the job myself and in my own time.


 Level of accountability:
I feel that I am inherently accountable for my work getting done correctly and on time. I do not want to be responsible for the work of others. I do not want to be held responsible for results that are out of my control. I want expectations to be clearly set by my manager at the beginning of the job and I will honor them. 

Negatives to positives - what *haven’t* you liked before, and what would be the positive version of that that you think you would like?

I don’t like having to be on site from exactly 9 - 5 every day. 
Positive version: I can work whenever from wherever as long as the job gets done.
I don’t like having a micromanaging supervisor
Positive version: My supervisor is on top of things, but gives me space and room to make my own decisions.

I don’t like a busy, loud office environment.
Positive version: A comfortable, peaceful environment that can accomodate conversations and has designated loud spaces for meetings.

What did you do with each?

I was good at performing - both in a theatrical context and in an educational one. 
I was good at creative writing both by myself and as part of a team.
I was good at hosting/interviewing/leading a conversation on my podcast.


Focus on the things you enjoyed and were proud of, or that you learned from (failures are important too!)
Things I enjoyed:
I enjoyed performing for an appreciative audience.
I enjoyed writing things that entertained people.
I enjoyed teaching someone something that they did not previously know - seeing them make connections.
I enjoyed working with fun, smart peers.
I enjoyed the feeling of accomplishment when all of the materials I prepared were laid out for MSI's workshop attendees to collect.

Things I’m proud of:
I am proud of my podcast, which won an award. I make it almost entirely on my own.
I am proud of writing my Master's thesis. It is the longest academic work I have ever produced.
I am proud of writing and performing in a one-man play in college.
I am proud of writing for Our Fair City, and knowing that fans care about the series.
I am proud of the voice acting work I have done in Our Fair City and Unwell.
I am proud of my institutional knowledge of MSI and the fact that I have worked there for so long.
I am proud that I orchestrated a clean-up and reorganization of MSI's material storage space. I championed bringing onboard a dedicated reorganizer and now he has a better job at MSI. 
I am proud that my bosses trust me enough to let me do my job without supervision.

Failures that I learned from:
I took the Administrative Coordinator job because I felt like I should make a change and seize a low-hanging opportunity. I discovered that having a terrible boss can make a job miserable and that the culture of the department is more important to me than the actual work that has to be accomplished.

I forgot to contact artists for the Port Clinton Arts festival and then lied to my Chair about it out of panic. He knew that I was lying, but he didn’t press the issue. I scrambled to correct my mistakes and I learned to: 1. Write down what tasks are expected of me (and when) and 2. Be honest with my employer, lying is toxic to a relationship.
